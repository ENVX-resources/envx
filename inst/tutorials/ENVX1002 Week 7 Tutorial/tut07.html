<h3>The <code>envx</code> package</h3>
<p>This tutorial is now available in the <code>envx</code> package on
GitHub, which allows you to access tutorials locally <em>and</em>
directly from your R console. While the package is in <em>very
early</em> development, it may be useful for students who are having
difficulties accessing tutorials via Binder, and so we have released it
with no other features at this time.</p>
<p><strong>To install the package, run the following code:</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;)
remotes::install_github(&quot;ENVX-resources/envx&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then load the package and use <code>list_tutorials()</code> to select
the tutorial you want to run:</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial will focus on running non-parametric versions of the
<em>t</em>-test. The <code>wilcox.test()</code> function in R is used to
perform the following tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</strong> – a non-parametric
version of the paired <em>t</em>-test and one-sample
<em>t</em>-test</li>
<li><strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U test)</strong> – a
non-parametric version of the two-sample <em>t</em>-test</li>
</ul>
<p>Work through the tutorial by answering the questions and completing
the exercises. We recommend that you create your own Quarto document if
you wish to record your answers and code.</p>

<div id="section-introduction-to-non-parametric-tests"
class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction to non-parametric tests</h2>
<p>Real-world data often do not meet the assumptions of parametric
tests, such as the normality of the data. In such cases, non-parametric
tests can be viable alternatives, especially when the sample size is
small and the data are skewed with outliers.</p>
<p>In this tutoral we will focus on the non-parametric versions of the
<em>t</em>-test, but there are many other non-parametric tests available
for different types of data.</p>
<div id="section-section" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>Before we start, it may be a good idea to review the
<strong>assumptions</strong> of the <em>t</em>-test, discuss the
differences between parametric and non-parametric tests, and understand
when to use each type of test.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-assumptions-of-the-t-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Assumptions of the <em>t</em>-test</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of <em>t</em>-test, the assumptions may vary
slightly.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-1" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>The <strong>one-sample <em>t</em>-test</strong> assumes that the data
are normally distributed.</p>
<p>The <strong>two-sample <em>t</em>-test</strong> assumes that the data
are normally distributed and have equal variances. However, if
<strong>paired data</strong> are used, the assumption of equal variances
is not necessary and the test is called a <strong>paired
<em>t</em>-test</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-violations-of-normality" class="section level3">
<h3>Violations of normality</h3>
<p>When the data are not normally distributed, our estimates of the mean
and standard deviation may be biased. This can lead to incorrect
conclusions when using parametric tests, especially when the sample size
is small i.e. &lt; 30.</p>
<p><strong>But what if sample size is larger than 30</strong>? Because
of how the Central Limit Theorem works, the <em>t</em>-test can be
robust to violations of normality when the sample size increases.
<strong>However, it is still important to check the assumptions because
the <em>t</em>-test is still affected by violations of homogeneity of
variances,</strong> and a “large” sample size can be subjective and vary
depending on the shape of the distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-normality" class="section level3">
<h3>Normality</h3>
<p>As usual, we should check the assumptions of the test
<strong>before</strong> proceeding. By now you should realise that we
diagnose possible violations of model assumptions by visualising the
data. With small sample sizes, it can be quite a challenge to determine
if the data are normally distributed from the raw data (or residuals,
once you learn how to access those later in this unit) alone. Formal
tests, such as the <strong>Shapiro-Wilk test</strong>, can be used to
check for normality in these cases.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-homogeneity-of-variances" class="section level3">
<h3>Homogeneity of variances</h3>
<p>Non-parametric tests are not that much concerned about homogeneity of
variances assumption but it can still be important to validate this
assumption – the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is sensitive to
<strong>symmetry</strong> whereas the Mann-Whitney U test is concerned
with the <strong>central location of the distribution(s)</strong>
(i.e. median), which are all strongly affected by the spread of the
data. If variances are equal, the results may be much easier to
interpret!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-what-are-the-non-parametric-tests-that-we-will-use"
class="section level3">
<h3>What are the non-parametric tests that we will use?</h3>
<p>We will look at the <strong>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</strong> and
the <strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum test</strong> (also known as the
Mann-Whitney U test).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-wilcoxon-signed-rank-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</h3>
<p>The <strong>Wilcoxon signed-rank test</strong> is a non-parametric
version of the paired <em>t</em>-test and one-sample <em>t</em>-test. It
is used to compare the means of two related groups when the data are not
normally distributed and has <strong>no assumptions about
normality</strong>, although it does assume <strong>symmetry</strong> in
the distribution <strong>IF THE SAMPLE IS DRAWN FROM A CONTINUOUS
DISTRIBUTION</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-2" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>Since this is often the case as we would have planned to perform a
<em>t</em>-test, it also means that we can formulate our hypotheses in
terms of the median (if we want) because in a symmetric distribution,
the mean and median are equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Wilcoxon rank-sum test</h3>
<p>The <strong>Wilcoxon rank-sum test</strong> (also known as the
Mann-Whitney U test) is a non-parametric version of the two-sample
<em>t</em>-test. It is used to compare the means of two independent
groups when the data are not normally distributed and has <strong>no
assumptions about normality</strong>. The test is concerned with the
<strong>central location of the distribution(s)</strong> (i.e. median)
and is more relaxed about symmetry. Instead, the assumption is that
<strong>the shape of the distribution is the same for both
groups</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-when-to-use-non-parametric-tests"
class="section level3">
<h3>When to use non-parametric tests</h3>
<p>The general approach is to always prefer parametric tests when the
assumptions are met. However, when the assumptions are violated,
non-parametric tests can be used as an alternative, but not before
trying to <strong>transform</strong> the data to meet the assumptions of
the parametric test first.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-3" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>These are <em>not</em> hard and fast rules, but general guidelines.
The choice of test should be based on the nature of the data and the
research question which takes time to develop as you gain more
experience in statistics.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-4" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>Importantly, non-parametric tests are less powerful than their
parametric counterparts, which means that they are less likely to detect
a true effect if it exists. This is because they are based on ranks
rather than the actual data values, which can lead to a loss of
information.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-5" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>And speaking of effect sizes, non-parametric tests do not have a
direct analogue to determine the effect size (although there are ways to
estimate it), which can make it difficult to interpret the practical
significance of the results.</p>
</div>

<p>Powell and Russell (1984, 1985) investigated differences in beetle
consumption between two size classes of eastern horned lizard
(<em>Phrynosoma douglassi brevirostre</em>) represented respectively by
adult females in the larger class and adult male and yearling females in
the smaller class.</p>
<p>We will use the data to test the hypothesis that the mean consumption
of beetles is the same between the two groups.</p>

<div id="section-hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<p>The null hypothesis is that the mean consumption of beetles is the
same between the two groups. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean
consumption of beetles is different between the two groups. Therefore we
have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[H_1: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> is the mean
consumption of beetles in size class 1 and <span
class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> is the mean consumption of beetles
in size class 2.</p>
<p><em>Note that we can alter the hypotheses to use medians instead of
means if we suspect that the data are not normally distributed and
require a non-parametric test.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="section-assumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>You’re doing this a lot, so let’s just say that you may benefit from
generating “template” code to quickly check the assumptions of the
two-sample <em>t</em>-test and other parametric tests in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-8" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>Let’s load the data and check the first few rows. The
<code>glimpse()</code> function is used here to check the data types of
each column.</p>

</div>
<div id="section-assumptions-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>Use a combination of histograms, boxplots and QQ-plots to check the
assumptions of the two-sample <em>t</em>-test. In reality these
exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps are eventually not published for
“the final report” so the sky’s the limit on how much you want to do to
understand your data. There is no need to make the plots pretty, too,
but we have done so here to make it easier to understand (and for you to
look at the code and practice).</p>

<p>At this stage we should attempt to transform the data to meet the
assumptions of the <em>t</em>-test. However, for the sake of this
tutorial, we will proceed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-test-statistic" class="section level3">
<h3>Test statistic</h3>
<p>We use the <code>wilcox.test()</code> function to perform the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Using the <code>BEETLES</code> variable as the
response and the <code>SIZE</code> variable as the grouping variable, we
can test the hypothesis that the mean consumption of beetles is the same
between the two groups.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wilcox.test(BEETLES ~ SIZE, data = beetle)</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="section-p-value-and-conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>P-value and conclusion</h3>
<p>The results show that the p-value is bigger than 0.05, which means
that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that
there is no significant difference in the mean consumption of beetles
between the two groups (W = 329, p = 0.07).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-section-11" class="section level3">
<h3></h3>
<p>At this point, we should compare the results of the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test with the two-sample <em>t</em>-test to see if the results are
consistent.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t.test(BEETLES ~ SIZE, data = beetle)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  BEETLES by SIZE
## t = 2.1907, df = 27.015, p-value = 0.03728
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group large and group small is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##    6.862606 209.577870
## sample estimates:
## mean in group large mean in group small 
##           170.42857            62.20833</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, violation of the normality assumption can lead to
different results between the two tests. In this case, the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test is more conservative and does not detect a significant
difference in the mean consumption of beetles between the two
groups.</p>

<h3>Test statistic</h3>
<p>Let’s perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the mean viral
load in cattle before and after treatment with the new drug. Because the
data is not tidy, we cannot use the formula syntax in the
<code>wilcox.test()</code> function. Instead, we will use the
<code>before</code> and <code>after</code> columns directly and supply
them as <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>wilcox.test(x = virus$after, y = virus$before, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;less&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Wilcoxon signed rank exact test
## 
## data:  virus$after and virus$before
## V = 3, p-value = 0.03906
## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is less than 0</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-p-value-and-conclusion-1" class="section level3">
<h3>P-value and conclusion</h3>
<p>The results show that the p-value is smaller than 0.05, which means
that we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we conclude that the
median viral load in cattle is lower after treatment with the new drug
(V = 3, p = 0.04).</p>
