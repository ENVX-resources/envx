# Contribute to `envx`

Contributions are currently limited to the development team due to the development stage of the package. However, we welcome feedback and suggestions for improvements -- click on the "Issues" tab above to submit your feedback.

## Version Control Standards

### Version Numbering
We follow semantic versioning with a development suffix:
- Format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` for releases (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<development>` for development versions (e.g., 1.0.0.9000)

#### Version Components
- **major**: Breaking changes or significant milestones
- **minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **patch**: Bug fixes only
- **development**: Numbers 9000+ for in-development versions

#### When to Increment
- Patch (e.g., 1.0.1): Bug fixes only
- Minor (e.g., 1.1.0): New features, backward compatible changes
- Major (e.g., 2.0.0): Breaking changes or API stability milestones
- Development (e.g., *.9001): Only when adding features that need detection

### Commit Standards
We use conventional commits to make the changelog maintainable:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: (minor) New feature
- `fix`: (patch) Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `build`: Changes affecting build system
- `ci`: CI configuration changes

#### Breaking Changes
Add `!` after type/scope and describe in footer:

```
feat!: remove deprecated API
BREAKING CHANGE: 'xyz' API has been removed
```

## Development Workflow

1. Update the version in DESCRIPTION:
   - For development: Add .9000 to current version
   - For release: Remove development suffix and increment according to changes

2. Make changes following conventional commits

3. Document changes in NEWS.md under the appropriate version heading

4. Before release:
   - Run tests: `devtools::test()`
   - Check package: `devtools::check()`
   - Update documentation: `devtools::document()`

## Adding new tutorials to `envx` package

1. Create a new tutorial using the `learnr` package. You should already know how to do this.
2. Save the tutorial in the `inst/tutorials` directory:
    - The folder name should be `ENVX#### Wk@ Tutorial`, where `###` is the course code and `@` is the week number to inform the user which week the tutorial is for. E.g., `ENVX1002 Wk1 Tutorial`.
    - The tutorial file can be named anything you like but I like `tut##.Rmd` where `##` is the tutorial number.
3. Any packages required for the tutorial are automatically installed when the user opens the tutorial. Alternatively, you can add the packages as dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file. A quick way is to use the `usethis` package:

```r
usethis::use_package("package_name")
```

4. Once you have done this build the package once:

```r
devtools::document()
devtools::install()
```

5. Then push the changes to the repository.
6. Remind students to update their package to get the new tutorials:

```r
remotes::install_github("ENVX-resources/envx")
